## Create a Digital Bank with Java and OO

### GFT Quality Assurance #1 - DIO (Digital Innovation One)

Challenge: Considering our knowledge in the banking domain, we will abstract an Object Oriented solution in Java. 
To do this, we will interpret the following scenario: “A bank offers its customers two types of accounts (current and savings),
which have the functionality of deposit, withdrawal and transfer (between the institution’s own accounts).”

New classes such as ContactUs and the DTO structure with Login class were implemented.
